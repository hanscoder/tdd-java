# Let's practice test driven development (TDD)

It used to practice TDD with java. The project is based on gradle and using JUnit 5.


## Running the tests

This depends on the IDE you are using. So have a look at your IDE's documentation.

If you want to use the command line then start the tests with

`````shell
$ ./gradlew -t test
`````

## Assertion

For the assertion the library AssertJ is used. Have a look at the [documentation](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) for further information.

## First step

Please delete the class ATest or rename it properly. This is just a simple example and has the purpose more or less to see if the build starts the tests and stops because of the failing test.
